   <h1>Two Solutions for the Negative Effects of Animal Farming on the Environment</h1> By Samantha Spound and Lucas Simms</p>
  <p style="text-align:left;">About the Problem: 

    Animals and agriculture farms are negatively impacting climate change. The current state of agriculture causes increases in temperature and carbon dioxide levels. Climate change is when a significant change happens to the average temperature in a specific place and when precipitation patterns change the conditions. Typically, this is driven by things that humans do such as burning fossil fuels, and building things in areas that are meant to be forest and farming. It increases greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which brings the temperature up. Animal farming also causes a lot of water contamination and air pollution in environments as well. 
    

    </p>
    <P>What causes it: 
      Animals such as goats, cows, or horses produce methane during digestion and when they eat. When their stomach is breaking down the food that they’ve eaten, this leads to the release of methane, which typically comes out during the time that the animals are being killed. The animals also release this specific gas when they are in stressful environments. A lot of farms that mass produce animals to be sold on the meat market have animals crammed together, living in stressful situations which leads to more methane being produced.  Methane  is also released in animal manure which  is stored  in big piles. This leads to lack of oxygen as the methane is produced when the organic matter decomposes.
      </P>
      <P> Who is most affected: 
        The people who are most affected a lot of the time are low income communities because these different communities can lack resources that can help them with climate change such as being more vulnerable to tornadoes or hurricanes or events that are disastrous. These events happen more often now that temperatures are rising. Other people who are affected are people who live near the ocean and in coastal areas. Ice is melting because the temperature is rising so sea levels are now rising and affecting communities that live near oceans or high level water areas. This leads to people losing their homes or their belongings. It can also affect farming and agriculture when there are changes in the weather that can affect how farms produce their products. This leads to not only the loss of jobs in the farming world, but also food and security and without farmers or farms, we wouldn’t be able to have a lot of the foods that we eat because farmers are a huge dependent we need.
        </P>


        <P>How does it affect the rest of society:
          It affects our society because it can lead to economic impacts which increase costs for different foods which leads to a lot of people not being able to access basic things such as milk or meat. It can impact people who rely on agriculture and farming as an economic source. Climate change also impacts the public because it impacts the air pollution, weather, And the health of the general public. Furthermore, it can cause specific places in America to become unlivable and that impacts housing security for so many people, especially low income areas.

    <p> This graph shows that animal farming alone contributes to 24% of all carbon emissions in the United States. So how do we start solving this issue? There are two small ways that farmers are doing so right now.
    </p>

    <p>Solution 1: Designate specific pathways for horses and farm animals  to avoid soil erosion and water contamination. </p>


    <p>As we noted before, animal farming pollutes waterways and the air. Research shows that soil and dirt erosion can pollute environments by spreading harmful bacteria and parasites into waterways and even the air. This happens when dirt from animal farms, whether it be from dirty stables or from pastures, erodes and spreads into the air and into lakes, streams, ponds, and sources of drinking water. The solution to this problem is simple, keep the animals and their habitat clean. Just look at horse farming for example. There are a ton of horse farms in the United States. According to a study done by Rutgers University, “The Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states are home to more than 428,000 horses, ponies, and mules living on about 65,000 farms.”(Rutgers University) 
    </p>


    <p> Tom Malone, a horse farmer in New Jersey knows all about this. Malone has owned  a prominent bus company in New Jersey for decades. It is a family owned and operates business that has been successful over the course of two different two centuries. A few years ago, he became a partial owner of a horse and pony farm in New Jersey. He has always had a focus on the environment. He also knows how important it is to keep his horses and their pens clean.  </p>

    <p>“We have definitely seen erosion on the paths commonly used by the horses. In fact, the pen where our horse riders train needs dirt replaced every few months from the traction. We have also seen erosion from the horses walking around in their pens, outside on the pastures, and on the pathways around the farm.” Malone said when initially asked about the issue. “We try to mitigate this by keeping the horses and their living areas clean, so that when erosion does occur the dirt isn't contaminated with bacteria and harmful parasites. A clean horse is much less likely to cause environmental harm we have found.” Malone said.  </p>

    <p>And there is evidence to back up Malone’s claim. Despite having several huge farms, Pennington, New Jersey has some of the cleanest drinking water in the state. In the town's latest water quality report, only 1 out of 39 water samples contained any potential harmful bacteria. (Borough, P. W. (n.d.). Penningtonboro. Annual Drinking Water Quality Report.) </p>


    <p> This shows that one solution the the problem is simply keeping animals and their living areas clean and not crowded.  </p>


    <p>Madison Spin, an avid equestrian who worked with Horses every day is very aware of this as well. “I think that humans definitely need to work on how they treat animals because that affects climate change and even though it’s always something that is going to happen,  it can definitely be lessened if animals are in a calmer environment” she said when talking about how many farm animals are treated poorly in the United States. When asked what she thinks could be done better on her part, she says “ the animals at our stable are treated really well but I think farms that use their animals for food need to have better training and not abuse animals because that negatively affects the environment”  </p>

    <p> Solution 2: Choose the correct bedding for animals and compost their manure:</p>

    <p>As Spin said, this will not fully stop farm animals from contributing to climate change. Afterall,  every animal still produces  methane and manure (poop) every single day! Animals produce methane in two ways. Firstly, the produce while digesting food and releasing the gas in the form of burps or gassing being passed through the intestines.  Secondly, methane is present and released in all animal feces. So, we must also find a way to minimize the negative effects of this pattern as well. Once again, there is a simple solution for this problem facing the climate. All animal farmers need to do is choose the right material for animal pens. According to one study, wheat straw is the most effective choice for animal bedding when it comes to reducing their methane and CO2 emissions. 
     </p>

     <img src= "./Simms Graph 2.jpeg"

     <p> As we can see, when wheat straw is used, more of the methane from the animals and their manure is absorbed. Wood chips are also pretty effective but slightly less so than wheat straw. It is no surprise that leaving the animals to sit in their own manure causes the most methane to be released into the air and environment. If farmers simply used wheat straw to house their animals, it would have huge, positive effects on the fight against climate change. But that is not all they can do.
    </p>

    <p> Animal manure is compostable. This simply means that their poop can be stored for a short period of time and then used to help plants grow for farmers. If farmers simply took the time to compost manure instead of mismanaging it and discarding it into local environments, the environment would benefit greatly according to studies. Tom Malone is also very aware of this. 
      “One of the ways we combat this is turning the manure into compost. We can then sell this to other farms or even use it on our own to help grow some plants and flowers. My wife owns a flower business and has a huge garden at home. I will sometimes take the composted manure home and use it for our flowers and such. It's my little way of trying to help the Environment” Malone said. 
      </p>

      <p> Overall, the solutions are simple. But simple does not mean free. Keeping animals and their pens clean, buying the proper bedding materials,and  composting/using manure takes time and money. Therefore, it is partially up to us as consumers to try and support local farms so that they can keep providing the best products for us while not harming the environment.
